We decided to build a concurrent video streaming app
the front end is built with react connecting to a express server using socket.io protocols
you can select a room and name on landing page once you click join room if the room you entered exists you will join that room if not then a new room will created. Others in the same room can pause play and seek everyones video. If you click open chat a side bar will open with a chat. You can send and recive messages where the message and name will be displayed.
